    <h2>FRONTEND TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
    <h3>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h3>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design the structure of web pages. It consists of a series of elements represented by tags, which define different parts of the content, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.</p>
    <p>HTML was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.</p>
    <h3>CSS(Cascading Style Sheets)</h3>
    <p>CSS is a stylesheet language that describes the presentation of HTML elements on a webpage. It separates content (HTML) from presentation, ensuring better maintainability, flexibility, and consistency across web projects.The purpose of CSS is to Styling Web Pages and Responsive Design.
    </p>
    <P>CSS was introduced by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie in 1994.</P>
    <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language essential for creating interactive and dynamic web applications. It operates primarily in the frontend, although it can also be used on the backend (e.g., Node.js). Below is an exploration of its theoretical foundation.
    </p>
    <p>JavaScript was introduced by Brendan Eich in 1995.</p>
    <h2>BACKEND TECHOLOGIES</h2>
    <h3>PYTHON</h3>
    <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility.</p>
    <p>Python was introduced by Guido van Rossum in 1991.
</p>
    <h3>Node.js</h3>
    <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and is primarily used for building scalable, high-performance web applications, particularly on the server-side.</p>
    <p>Node.js was introduced by Ryan Dahl in 2009.</p>
    <h3>React.js</h3>
    <p>React.js, commonly referred to as React, is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs), particularly for single-page applications (SPAs). It was developed by Facebook (now Meta) and is maintained by Facebook and a community of developers.</p>
    <p>React.js was introduced by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, in 2011.</p>
    <h2>DATABASE</h2>
    <h3>MYSQL</h3>
    <p>MySQL is one of the most widely used relational database management systems (RDBMS).MySQL is a powerful database management system that uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing databases.It is open-sourced.
</p>
    <p>It was originally created by MySQL AB in 1995.</p>
    <h3>Mongodb</h3>
    <p>MongoDB is a popular, open-source, NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, document-oriented format. Unlike traditional relational databases, which store data in tables with rows and columns, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents using BSON (Binary JSON), making it well-suited for applications that deal with unstructured or semi-structured data.</p>
    <p>MongoDB was introduced by 10gen, which later became MongoDB, Inc.. It was initially released in 2009 by a team led by Eliot Horowitz and Dwight Merriman. </p>
